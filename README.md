In this one, you'll be able to learn many stuff from ML, dart programming language, Go lang, javascript and many more.


# 1. Machine Learning for beginners 
> In this tutorial, you'll be able to learn how to use Tensorflow, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib etc.. for your projects and other applications.

I would recommend you to learn the stack as follows for ease of learning and better understanding :
```
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
Tensorflow
OpenCV
```

To set things up, go to your project folder => open terminal there => activate the environment => run the below command
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
this might show some errors, so be sure to upgrade your pip and have python installed and set up.
